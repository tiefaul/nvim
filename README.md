# About

**This repo is supposed to be used as config by NvChad users!**

### Installation

To use this Neovim configuration, ensure you are running **Neovim v0.11.4 or later**.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Replace the contents of your local Neovim config directory:

```
~/.config/nvim/
```
with the contents of the cloned `nvim` folder.

3. Remove the `.git` directory from the copied files to avoid tracking this config as a Git repository.
4. Update file ownership to match your user:

```
chown -R user:user ~/.config/nvim
```

After completing these steps, restart Neovim to apply the configuration.
